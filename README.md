# Trackr UI

Frontend UI for the Trackr app built using React.

## Trackr

Trackr is a simple (for now!) vehicle mileage tracking app. Input mileage + gas used
and mpg will be figured out of the long term. Future features will add in notifications
for due service.

## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

Head to `localhost:3000` for all the Trackr/React UI goodness
